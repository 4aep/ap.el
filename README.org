#+TITLE: ap.el

This is a simple Emacs config focused on editing Emacs Lisp.  It's mostly intended as a sample from which others may borrow code or inspiration, but it may also be used as-is.  It's not intended to be a supported project, such as Spacemacs or DOOM.

It requires Emacs 28 or later.

No documentation is provided, as the code in =init.el= should be self-explanatory.  Take it or leave it, as-is.  :)

Note that this is not the author's main, personal Emacs configuration.  But it might evolve into being part of it.
